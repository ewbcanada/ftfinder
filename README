The Fair Trade Finder creates a database of locations serving Fair Trade 
products, and interfaces with Google Maps to provide a visual interface for 
finding these locations.

The Fair Trade Finder was originally developed by Engineers Without Borders 
Canada for use on the http://www.playyourpart.ca site, in partnership with 
Transfair Canada.

This project is no longer actively maintained, but is released under the GNU 
General Public License in the hope that it may be useful (third-party libraries 
bundled with this software may be separately licensed - in these cases, license 
notices have been retained in the appropriate files).

Donations to Engineers Without Borders Canada may be made at

REQUIREMENTS

This software requires PHP/mySQL, as well as the following packages:
- mod_rewrite

- mySQL geocalc functions (provided in the tools directory; and on the web at 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/geocalc-udf/ though this seems to be an 
  older version)

- php-xml

- the Smarty templating engine (included under smarty/)


INSTALLING

Obtain a Google Maps API key (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html)

Create a config.php file (see config.php.sample), modifying as needed with your 
mySQL settings and Google Maps key

In the tools directory, run the import.php script (either providing your own 
.csv spreadsheet of initial data, or using our test data)


TO-DO

- the admin features are mostly un-tested, and need a lot of cleanup

- it'd be really cool to allow user-submitted locations and ratings!
  (perhaps use the code in admin/ as a base for this?)

- clean up js/mapping.js and update to use jQuery

- make products and location types dynamic

- probably many others

Have some time to contribute to these features?  We'd love your help!
